1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

   I write my programs with plenty of comments, as well as while following the general coding guidelines (such as proper indentation and spacing). Working in this way helps me keep track of my code and helps me edit/refine the code itself. I can use this CRUD Python module in the future by implementing it in other classes dealing with databases, as it is pretty helpful in manipulating database data.

2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

   I first approach a problem from a software engineering standpoint: How could I create a program to streamline the process at hand? This helps me set the stage with what the requirements are and clarifies the exact issue and why it needs to be solved. This approach differs from previous assignments in prior courses based on the knowledge of coding I now have, where I have refined and honed my skills. One particular technique I could use in the future to create a database to meet the clients requests is by incorporating feedback and not being afraid of critique.

3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists solve various issues dealing with software, programs, and data, which matters because of this age of information, which revolves around technology and its various challenges. My work on this type of project helps companies like Grazioso Salvare to do their work better by simplifying how users can interact with and manipulate data through streamlined means.
